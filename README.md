## Intro
  Road crack detection has vital importance in driving safety. However, it is
  very challenging because of the complexity of the background, cracks are
  easily confused with foreign objects, shadows, background textures and are
  also inhomogeneous. Many methods have been proposed for this task, but
  Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) are promising for crack classification
  and segmentation with high accuracy and precision. Another method that
  is being studied is the use of quaternions. Quaternions have the advantage
  of providing more structural information of the color and as a result offer
  better learning results and avoid overfitting. In this study we focused on
  implementing various cnn networks and compare their results with Quaternion Convolutional Neural Networks         (QCNN) which are an extension of the
  cnn in the quaternion domain. Specifically we replaced the convolutional
  and linear layers of the cnn’s with quaternion convolutional layers and linear
  layers respectively.
